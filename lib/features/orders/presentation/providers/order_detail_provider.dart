// resolved value forever once fetched, so reopening the same order
// later — e.g. after a rider cancels it outside this screen — would
// keep replaying the stale pre-cancellation snapshot rather than
// refetching. Socket-driven invalidation (order_live_sync_provider)
// only helps while connected; this guarantees a fresh fetch on every
// screen visit regardless of missed/late socket events.
